Title: Insecure Permissions On Files / Directories In Current User's PATH

[ description ]

Some programs/directories in the path of the user used to perform this audit have weak permissions.

The following programs/DLLs in current user's PATH can be manipulated by non-administrator users:

    File C:\Users\svc_loanmgr\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps\wlbsctrl.dll has weak permissions: ALLOW EGOTISTICALBANK\svc_loanmgr: FILE_WRITE_DATA FILE_APPEND_DATA DELETE WRITE_DAC WRITE_OWNER
    File C:\Users\svc_loanmgr\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WindowsApps has weak permissions: ALLOW EGOTISTICALBANK\svc_loanmgr: FILE_ADD_FILE FILE_ADD_SUBDIRECTORY FILE_WRITE_EA FILE_DELETE_CHILD FILE_WRITE_ATTRIBUTES DELETE WRITE_DAC WRITE_OWNER

[ recommendation ]

Review the permissions that have been granted to non-administrative users and revoke access where possible.

Title: Non-Admin Can Change File Paths In Registry

[ description ]

A walk of the registry found some registry keys that can be changed by non-admin users (KEY_SET_VALUE permission). The data in some of those keys appears to be a file or directory path (e.g. c:\..., \host\share, \.\pipe\...). This is a simple regular-expression match so may report false positives. In some instances it may be possible for an low-privilged user to cause other users to follow a malicious UNC file path, forcing disclosure of their netntlm password hash or SMB relay attack. Other path-based attacks may also be possible.

The following registry value are affected:

Title: Non-Admin Can Change Registry Paths That Are Stored In The Registry

[ description ]

A walk of the registry found some registry keys that can be changed by non-admin users (KEY_SET_VALUE permission). The data in some of those keys appears to be a registry path (e.g. SYSTEM\...). This is a simple regular-expression match so may report false positives. In some instances it may be possible for an low-privilged user to cause other users to follow read malicious data from the registry. The may or may not lead to privilege escalation depending on the context.

Title: SMB Client Does Not Mandate Packet Signing

[ description ]

SMB connection originating from this host might not negotiate pack signing. As signing protects data from modification in transit, clients may end up sending or receiving data that has been maliciously altered by an attacker. This could lead to a compromise of the client or server.

The following registry key shows the current policy setting:

    Reg key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\RequireSecuritySignature, Value: 0

Title: Directory Creation Allowed On Drive Root

[ description ]

Some of the local drive roots allow non-administrative users to create directories. This could provide attackers with a place to stash hacking tools, or proive legitimacy to malware they are seeking to get other users to run. It is relatively common to allow the creation of directories in the drive root, but it probably isn't required for normal operation. NB: This issue has only been reported for NTFS filesystems. Other non-NTFS file system may also allow this behaviour. A separate issue is reported for non-NTFS filesystems.

The following drives allow non-administrative users to create directories in to their root:

    Drive C:\ allows BUILTIN\Users to add directories

[ recommendation ]

Modify the permissions on the drive roots to only allow administrators to create directories. Revoke this permission from low-privileged users.

Title: Current Working Directory Used For DLL Search - Including Network Locations

[ description ]

CWDIllegalInDllSearch was set to 0. This causes applications (by default) to load DLLs from the current directory - even for network locations. This can lead to malicious DLLs being executed in some attack scenarios. Note that KB2264107 needs to be installed to enable more secure settings - not checked for. Also apps can be secured individually - also not checked for.

The following registry key shows the current policy setting:

    Reg key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\CWDIllegalInDllSearch, Value: None

[ recommendation ]

Consider setting CWDIllegalInDllSearch to 1, 2 or 0xFFFFFFFF to improve security - though this may break some applications. See http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2264107 for further information including how to set CWDIllegalInDllSearch on a per-application basis.
