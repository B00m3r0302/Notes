- looked at the 5 ships and see that all of them except for ours have the number 2
- You can also upload weights to the model so I am going to look at the h5 file to see what the weights are and how to modify them. 
- need to use python3-h5py to do this.
- 2 weights 
```
['model_weights', 'optimizer_weights']
```
- Didn't get a ton of information
- going to use tensorflow to see if I get more
