# What is a Windows process? 
A Windows process is a program or application that is running on a Windows machine. A process can be started by either a user or by the system itself. The process consumes resources such as memory, disk space and processor time to complete a task.
# Process Threads
Windows processes are made up of one or more threads that are all running concurrently. A thread is a set of instructions that can be executed independently within a process.Threads within a process can communicate and share data. Threads are scheduled for execution by the operating system and managed in the context of a process. 
# Process Memory
Windows processes also use memory to store data and instructions. Memory is allocated to a process when it is created and the amount that is allocated can be set by the process itself. The operating system manages memory using both virtual and physical memory. Virtual memory allows the operating system to use more memory than what is physically available by creating virtual address space that can be accessed by the applications. These virtual address spaces are divided into "pages" which are then allocated to processes.
# Memory Types
Processes can have different types of memory:
- Private memory
	- Is dedicated to a single process and cannot be shared by other processes. This type of memory is used to store data that is specific to the process.
- Mapped memory
	- Can be shared between two or more processes. It is used to share data between processes, such as shared libraries, shared memory segments, and shared files. Mapped memory is visible to other processes, but is protected from being modified by other processes.
- Image memory
	- Contains the code and data of an executable file. It is used to store the code and data that is used by the process, such as the program's code, data, and resources. Image memory is often related to DLL files loaded into a process's address space.
# Process Environment Block (PEB)
The Process Environment Block (PEB) is a data structure in Windows that contains information about a process such as its parameters, startup information, allocated heap information, and loaded DLLs, in addition to others. It is used by the operating system to store information about processes as they are running, and is used by the Windows loader to launch applications. It also stores information about the process such as the process ID (PID) and path to the executable.

Every process created has its own PEB data structure, that will contain its own set of information about it. 
# PEB Structure
The PEB struct in C is shown below. The reserved members of this struct can be ignored.
```c
typedef struct _PEB {
  BYTE                          Reserved1[2];
  BYTE                          BeingDebugged;
  BYTE                          Reserved2[1];
  PVOID                         Reserved3[2];
  PPEB_LDR_DATA                 Ldr;
  PRTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS  ProcessParameters;
  PVOID                         Reserved4[3];
  PVOID                         AtlThunkSListPtr;
  PVOID                         Reserved5;
  ULONG                         Reserved6;
  PVOID                         Reserved7;
  ULONG                         Reserved8;
  ULONG                         AtlThunkSListPtr32;
  PVOID                         Reserved9[45];
  BYTE                          Reserved10[96];
  PPS_POST_PROCESS_INIT_ROUTINE PostProcessInitRoutine;
  BYTE                          Reserved11[128];
  PVOID                         Reserved12[1];
  ULONG                         SessionId;
} PEB, *PPEB;
```
The non-reserved members are explained below.
## BeingDebugged
BeingDebugged is a flag in the PEB structure hat indicates whether the process is being debugged or not. It is set to 1 (TRUE) when the process is being debugged and 0 (FALSE) when its not. It is used by the Windows loader to determine whether to launch the application with a debugger attached or now. 

## LDR
Ldr is a pointer to a "PEB_LDR_DATA" structure in the PEB. This structure contains information about the processes's loaded DLL modules. It includes a list of the DLLs loaded in the process, base address of the DLL, and the size of each module. It is used by the Windows loader to keep track of DLLs loaded in the process. The "PEB_LDR_DATA" struct is shown below
```c
typedef struct _PEB_LDR_DATA {
  BYTE       Reserved1[8];
  PVOID      Reserved2[3];
  LIST_ENTRY InMemoryOrderModuleList;
} PEB_LDR_DATA, *PPEB_LDR_DATA;
```
"LDR" can be leveraged to find the base address of a particular DLL, as well as which functions reside within its memory space. This will be used in future modules to build a custom version of "GetModuleHandleA/W" for added stealth

## ProcessParameters
ProcessParameters is a data structure in the PEB. It contains the command line parameters passed to the process when created. The Windows loader adds these parameters to the process's PEB structure.
