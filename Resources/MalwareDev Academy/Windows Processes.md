# What is a Windows process? 
A Windows process is a program or application that is running on a Windows machine. A process can be started by either a user or by the system itself. The process consumes resources such as memory, disk space and processor time to complete a task.
# Process Threads
Windows processes are made up of one or more threads that are all running concurrently. A thread is a set of instructions that can be executed independently within a process.Threads within a process can communicate and share data. Threads are scheduled for execution by the operating system and managed in the context of a process. 
# Process Memory
Windows processes also use memory to store data and instructions. Memory is allocated to a process when it is created and the amount that is allocated can be set by the process itself. The operating system manages memory using both virtual and physical memory. Virtual memory allows the operating system to use more memory than what is physically available by creating virtual address space that can be accessed by the applications. These virtual address spaces are divided into "pages" which are then allocated to processes.
# Memory Types
Processes can have different types of memory:
- Private memory
	- Is dedicated to a single process and cannot be shared by other processes. This type of memory is used to store data that is specific to the process.
- Mapped memory
	- Can be shared between two or more processes. It is used to share data between processes, such as shared libraries, shared memory segments, and shared files. Mapped memory is visible to other processes, but is protected from being modified by other processes.
- Image memory
	- Contains the code and data of an executable file. It is used to store the code and data that is used by the process, such as the program's code, data, and resources. Image memory is often related to DLL files loaded into a process's address space.
