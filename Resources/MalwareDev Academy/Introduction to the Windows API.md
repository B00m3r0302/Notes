# Introduction
The Windows API provides developers with a way for their applications to interact with the Windows operating system. For example if the application needs to display something to the screen, modify a file or query the registry all of these actions can be done via the Windows API. The Windows API is very well documented by Microsoft and can be viewed below

## Windows data types
The Windows API has many data types outside of the well known ones. The data types are documented and can be viewed below
- https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types
Some of the common data types are listed below:
- DWORD
	- A 32-bit unsigned integer, on bot 32-bit and 64-bit systems, used to represent values from 0 up to (2^32 -1)
```c
DWORD dwVariable = 42;
```
- size_t
	- Used to represent the size of an object.
	- It is a 32-bit unsigned integer on 32-bit systems representing values from 0 up to (2^32 -1).
	- On the other hand it's a 64-bit unsigned integer on 64-bit systems representing values from 0 up to (2^64 -1)
```c
SIZE_T sVariable = sizeof(int);
```
- VOID
	- Indicates the absence of a specific data type
```c
void* pVariable = NULL; // This is the same as PVOID
```
- PVOID
	- A 32-bit or 4-byte pointer of any data type on 32-bit systems.
	- Alternatively a 64-bit or 8-byte pointer of any data type on 64-bit systems.
```c
PVOID pVariable = &SomeData;
```
- HANDLE
	- A value that specifies a particular object that the operating system is managing (e.g. file, process, thread)
```c
HANDLE hFile = CreateFile(...);
```
- HMODULE
	- A handle to a module
	- This is the base address of the module in memory
	- An example of a MODULE can be a DLL or EXE file
```c
HMODULE hModule = GerModuleHandle(...);
```
- LPCSTR/PCSTR
	- A pointer to a constant null-terminated string of 8-bit Windows characters  (ANSI)
	- The "L" stands for "long" which is derived from the 16-bit Windows programming period, nowadays it doesn't affect the data type, but the naming convention still exists
	- The "C" stands for "constant" or read-only variable.
	- Both of these data types are equivalent to "const char*"
```c
LPCSTR lpcString = "Hello, world!";
PCSTR  pcString  = "Hello, world!";
```
- LPSTR/PSTR
	- The same as "LPCSTR" and "PCSTR" the only difference is that "LPSTR" and "PCSTR" do not point to a constant variable and instead point to a readable and writable string
	- Both of these data types are equivalent to "char*"
```c
LPSTR lpString = "Hello, world! ";
PSTR pString = "Helo, world!";
```
- LPCWSTR/PCWSTR
	- A pointer to a constant null-terminated string of 16-bit Windows Unicode characters (Unicode)
	- Bot these data types are equivalent to "const wchar*"
```c
LPCWSTR lpwcString = L"Hello, world!";
PCWSTR pcwString = L"Hello, world!";
```
- PWSTR/LPWSTR
	- The same as "LPCWSTR" and "PCWSTR" the only difference is that "PWSTR" and "LPWSTR" do not point to a constant variable and instead point to a readable and writable string. 
	- Both these data types are equivalent to "wchar*"
```c
LPWSTR lpwString = L"Hello, world!";
PWSTR pwString = L"Hello, world!";
```
- ULONG_PTR
	- Represents an unsigned integer that is the same size as a pointer on the specified architecture, meaning on 32-bit systems a "ULONG_PTR" will be 32 bits in size
	- On 64-bit systems int will be 64 bits in size
	- ULONG_PTR is used in the manipulatigR)Pointer + 10; // allowed
## Data types pointers
The Windows API allows a developer to declare a data type directly or a pointer to the data type. 
this is reflected in the data type names where the data types that start with "P" represent pointers to the actual data type while the ones that don't start with "P" represent the actual data type itself
The following will become useful when working with Windows APIs that have parameters that are pointers to a data type. 
EXAMPLE
- These show how the "P" data type relates to its non-pointer equivalent
- "PHANDLE" is the same as "HANDLE*"
- "PSIZE_T" is the same as "SIZE_T*"
- "PDWORD" is the same ad "DWORD*"
## ANSI & Unicode functions
The majority of Windows API functions have 2 version ending with either "A" of "W"
For example there is "CreatefileA" and "CreateFileW".
The functions ending with "A" indicate "ANSI" whereas the functions ending with "W" represent Unicode or "wide".
The main difference is that ANSI functions will take in ANSI data types as parameters where applicable whereas Unicode functions will take in Unicode data types.
EXAMPLE
The first parameter forr "CreateFileA" is "SPCSTR",  which is a pointer to a constant-null terminate string of 8-bit Windows ANSI characters.
On the other hand, the first parameter for "CreateFileW" is "LPCWSTR", a pointer to a constant null-terminated string of 16-bit Unicode characters
Furthermore the number of required bytes will differ dememding on which version is used
```c
char str1[] = "maldevv"; // 7 bytes (maldev + null byte)
wchar str2[] = L"maldev
; // 14 bytesm each character is 2 bytes and the null byte is also 2 bytes
```
